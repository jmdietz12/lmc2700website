            <h2>Website 1: Breath of the Wild Compendium</h2>
            <p>Using public API and Streamlit in CS 1301, I was able to make a useful website that displays weapons, items, etc.
            and tell stats about them in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I included 3 search features: by
            name, by item number, or randomly by category.

            <h2>Website 2: Harry Potter/Georgia Tech Sorting Quiz</h2>
            <p>I created a "Buzz Feed" style form in CS 1301 that would ask questions about Georgia Tech related 
                things and sort the user into a Hogwarts house. I used different html form features and if statements to
                determine the house.

            <h2>Game: Galactic Robotz</h2>
            <p>Using an online course in high school, I was able to design and partially program a platformer game
                in Unity. It utilizes enemies, collectables, and other platforming elements. It has some bug problems due
                to the hardware limitations I had at the time.

            <h2>Program: Atlanta Braves Lightsaber</h2>
            <p> The coding was light for this, only having to add in a prebuilt line of code to determine the color and
                timing. I converted videos and sound bites into .wav files to the specific kbps 
                needed by the lightsaber using DiVinci Resolve.
